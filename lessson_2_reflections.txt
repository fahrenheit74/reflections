What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a new file .git. This holds metadata on the files. 
When files are committed the metadata is updated.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files that will be committed. It groups the file together. Files grouped together should be similar and contain related fixes.
